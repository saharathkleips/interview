    "This idea can be modeled as a depth-first search. At each adapter find the list of valid connections and then find all of their valid connections and then count the routes that lead to the end. Basically every valid connection is a \"branch\" and only the ones that connect to the end are counted. However, the input is really large, so calculating each route will take a really long time. We can \"memoize\" the call by storing the result of each adapter that was visited. If a subsequent visit to that adapter occurs, rather than calculating the configurations again, we can just return what was calculated previously. We know the configuration is unique because the adapter was not previously stored."
