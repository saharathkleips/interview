    "There's probably a mathematical solution to this, but I don't know it. A similar algorithm I would consider as well is to put all of the `LineSegment::points` into a grid, and then count the number of times a cell was updated (2+ would be an intersection). However, I decided to `intersect` since I felt like it was neat way to solve it (and it uses `Set::intersect` and we're looking for line intersections, so that's fun).\r\n",
