    "Given A, B, C, and D, sort them into their respective rooms (left to right). Moving A a cell costs 1 unit, B - 10 units, C - 100 units, and D - 1000 units. Elements cannot stop in the cell directly outside any room. They can never move from the hallway to a room unless it is their destination room and only contain their matching element. Once an element stops moving within a hallway, it will stay in that spot until it can move into a room. What is the least amount of energy to sort all the elements?"
