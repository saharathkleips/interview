To calculate the states is just the permutations of the sum of all 3 dice rolls returning 1, 2, and 3 each.\n",
    "\n",
    "To play the game efficiently, we need to utilize memoization. We can cache the result of how many wins a certain \"game state\" achieves so that if and when we encounter it again, we can quickly aggregate the wins rather than recalculating it. A game state can be quickly \"serialized\" into a key by identifying that the variables that affect the game's outcome are both players position and current score and whose turn it is."
